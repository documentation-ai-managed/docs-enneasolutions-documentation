## Data Sharing and Security Protocols

You share only necessary data via encrypted channels. All integrations use HTTPS and comply with HIPAA and GDPR.

<Expandable title="Security Best Practices" default-open="false">

Enable webhook signatures to verify payloads:

```
X-Ennea-Signature: v1.{hmac_sha256_signature}
```

Validate signatures using your shared secret.
